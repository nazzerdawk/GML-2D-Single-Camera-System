/*
	Hello! This is a camera system I refined from a tutorial from PixelatedPope on Youtube. 
		(GMS2 Cameras: As Simple as Possible / https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g1LQ6aIJFk)  
	I wanted a camera object that was easy to import into other projects with minimal setup, and I wanted it to support zooming in/out,
	easy customization, and fewer "magic numbers" littering the code (Fine for a tutorial, less so for something I want to reuse).
	
	This only requires 4 events in a camera object, and has clearly delinieated properties the user can edit. 
	
	To set this up, simply place camera_init() in the create event, camera_update() in the end step event, and zoom_in() and zoom_out() in the events for 
		whatever keys you'd like assigned to them, such as + and -, < and >, or the mouse wheel up and down. 
	
	To adjust the behavior of the camera, the Properties struct inside of camera_init() contains the variables for the aspect ratio, the default zoom level, etc. 
	Important: replace  obj_character in the properties struct with the actual object you want the camera to follow. 
	
	
	!!!IMPORTANT!!! !!!IMPORTANT!!! !!!IMPORTANT!!!
	
	This requires GMS2. I specifically used GameMaker LTS v2022.0.1.30, but it should probably work with pretty much all versions of GMS2/GameMaker
	beyond Game Maker Studio 1.

		zoom_increment : 20,				//How far to move the camera for each step of zooming in/out
		zoom_min : 20,						//The closest you can zoom in. For best results, use a multiple of the increment. 
		zoom_max : 300,						//The furthest you can zoom in. For best results, use a multiple of the increment.
